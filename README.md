# Chen's Classic Items

## Description

An extension mod for **ThinkInvis.ClassicItems**!

This mod also adds items (and artifacts) from Risk of Rain 1 that did not make it to Risk of Rain 2.

For this mod's API, the documentation can be found in the **[wiki](https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/RoR2-ClassicItems/wiki/xeu4S0yNjk4zZlj9T72lMw)**.

## Installation
